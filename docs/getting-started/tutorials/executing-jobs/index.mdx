# Executing Your First Job

The following tutorial walks you through how to create and execute an example JobConfig, as well as scheduling future Jobs.

## Create a JobConfig

First, create an example [JobConfig](../../../execution/jobconfig/index.md).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="fromURL" label="From URL" default>

Install the [example JobConfig](https://github.com/furiko-io/furiko/blob/main/examples/jobconfigs/10-example-jobconfig.yaml) from GitHub in a single one-liner:

```shell
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/furiko-io/furiko/main/examples/jobconfigs/10-example-jobconfig.yaml
```

For more explainable and runnable examples of JobConfigs, refer to <https://github.com/furiko-io/furiko/tree/main/examples/jobconfigs>.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="Manually" default>

Copy the following and save it into a local file, editing it as necessary:

```yaml title=example-jobconfig.yaml
apiVersion: execution.furiko.io/v1alpha1
kind: JobConfig
metadata:
  name: example-jobconfig
spec:
  # Defines how the JobConfig shall be executed automatically on schedule.
  schedule:
    cron:
      expression: "*/5 * * * *"
    disabled: true

  # Prevents multiple executions of the same JobConfig.
  concurrency:
    policy: Forbid

  # Defines how to create the Job.
  template:
    spec:
      taskTemplate:
        pod:
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: container
                image: alpine
                command:
                  - echo
                  - "Hello World"
```

Next, apply the YAML to the cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f example-jobconfig.yaml
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Executing the Job

Using the [`furiko` command-line tool](../../cli.mdx), execute the Job immediately as an [ad-hoc execution](../../../execution/job/adhoc-execution.md):

```sh
furiko run example-jobconfig
```

You can view more details about the Job that was executed (press `Tab` to expand to the most recent job execution):

```sh
furiko get job example-jobconfig-
```

The following is a real-time demo of the above steps:

## Enable automatic scheduling

The above example JobConfig is in `ReadyDisabled` state initially. Enable the JobConfig's schedule:

```sh
furiko enable example-jobconfig
```

The above [cron expression](../../../execution/jobconfig/cron-syntax.md) is `*/5 * * * *`, which means to run every 5 minutes. Wait for a while, and you should be able to see that the Job was automatically scheduled:

```sh
furiko list job --for=example-jobconfig
```

The above command lists all recent Jobs that were executed by the JobConfig. You should see something similar to the following output:

```
NAME                           PHASE       START TIME   RUN TIME   FINISH TIME
example-jobconfig-1670952000   Succeeded   16s                     16s
```

## Scheduling future executions

We can also [schedule a future execution](../../../execution/job/start-policy.md) for the JobConfig:

import Time from "@site/src/components/Time";

<code>
  furiko run example-jobconfig --at <Time offset={5 * 60} truncate={5 * 60} />
</code>

:::tip
The timestamp above is dynamically generated to be at most 5 minutes in the future - copy the code block and try it out!
:::

This queues the Job to be executed at a later time. List all jobs for the JobConfig again:

```sh
furiko list job --for=example-jobconfig
```

We should now see that the Job is in the `Queued` state.

```
NAME                           PHASE       START TIME   RUN TIME   FINISH TIME
example-jobconfig-5wpnv        Queued
```

We can view more information about the Job before it has started running:

```sh
furiko get job example-jobconfig-5wpnv
```

We should see that it is indeed not yet started, and will be started in a few minutes time:

```
JOB INFO
Name:                example-jobconfig-5wpnv
Namespace:           default
Type:                Adhoc
Created:             Wed, 14 Dec 2022 01:26:23 +08:00 (9 seconds ago)
Job Config:          example-jobconfig
Start After:         Wed, 14 Dec 2022 01:30:00 +08:00 (in 3 minutes)
Concurrency Policy:  Enqueue

JOB STATUS
Phase:    Queued
Reason:   NotYetDue
Message:  Job is queued to start no earlier than 2022-12-13 17:30:00 +0000 UTC
```

In the above example, notice that the job is scheduled to be started exactly at `01:30:00`. By right, the cron schedule `*/5 * * * *` should have also scheduled another Job at `01:30:00`. However, since we are using the `Forbid` [concurrency policy](../../../execution/jobconfig/concurrency.md), this prevents multiple concurrent Jobs from being executed at the same time.

After waiting until `01:30:00`, we can verify that there were indeed no other executions that started at the same time:

```sh
NAME                           PHASE       START TIME   RUN TIME   FINISH TIME
example-jobconfig-1670952300   Succeeded   6m                      6m
example-jobconfig-1670952600   Succeeded   1m                      1m
```
