## Introduction

Furiko is a Kubernetes-native operator for managing, scheduling and executing scheduled and adhoc jobs and workflows. It aims to be a general-purpose job platform that supports a diverse range of use cases, including cron jobs, parallel batch processing, workflow automation, etc.

Furiko is built from the beginning to support enterprise-level use cases and running self-hosted in a private Kubernetes cluster, supporting users across a large organization.

Some use cases that are perfect for Furiko include:

- Cron-based scheduling massive amounts of periodic jobs per day in a large organization
- Scheduling some jobs to run once at a later time with some parameters
- Starting multiple jobs to execute one after another, once the previous job has finished
- Running multiple parallel, indexed tasks within a single job execution
- Event-driven, offline/asynchronous job processing
- Building a platform to automate business operations via form-based inputs (with Furiko as the job engine)

## Why Choose Furiko

There are several other workflow platforms available for Kubernetes today. Furiko specializes in **time-based scheduling**, taking an emphasis on **correctness and scale**, providing an out-of-the-box solution to run massive amounts of job executions every day without missing a beat.

Initially developed as an internal project in Shopee, Furiko prides itself on being optimized to support **millions of job executions per day** across multiple clusters internally, while being expressive enough to support a multitude of business use cases. At the same time, Furiko offers **high consistency and reliability** in the face of failure or restarts to prevent double runs and missed runs.

Furiko is designed to be used both as a standalone platform, or as a framework for more complex platforms that build on top of Furiko, such as IT automation or customer service portals.
