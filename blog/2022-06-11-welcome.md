Welcome to the brand-new Furiko website! 🎉

The new website is powered by [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), which is a modern static-site generator. The old documentation site was using [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) which has definitely seen better days.

Many features such as versioning felt rather clunky to work around, and we needed additional blogging support as well. I decided to pull the trigger to migrate the old website to Docusaurus, which had been a breeze to do so. The old documentation site based on Mkdocs can be found here: <https://github.com/furiko-io/docs>

Enjoy the new website! 😁
